This is a Python script that is a part of a larger system, possibly a monitoring or backup agent. The code is quite extensive, but heres a summary of the main components and their functions:

## Logging and Setup

- The script sets up logging with a basic configuration and creates a logger instance.
- It defines a global flag running to control the agent's running state.
FastAPI Web Interface

- The script creates a FastAPI application (app) to provide a web interface for the agent.
= It mounts a static directory (static) to serve static files like CSS and images.
The read_root function returns the static index.html file from the static directory.

## Authentication

- The obtain_jwt function attempts to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) by authenticating with a server using a system UUID and password.
- It retries the authentication process with exponential backoff in case of failures.

## Shutdown and Restart Handlers

- The script defines signal handlers for shutdown (SIGINT and SIGTERM) and restart (SIGUSR1) signals.
- The handle_shutdown function sets the running flag to False when a shutdown signal is received.
- The handle_restart function restarts the agent process when a restart signal is received.

## Websocket and RabbitMQ Connection

- The agent function is the main entry point for the agent.
- It obtains a system UUID and attempts to authenticate with the server using the obtain_jwt function.
- If authentication succeeds, it establishes a WebSocket connection to the server and sets up a RabbitMQ connection using aio_pika.
- The consume_messages function consumes messages from the RabbitMQ queue and dispatches them to handlers based on the message type.

## Handlers

- The handle_repo_snapshots function handles messages of type repo_snapshots by executing a restic command to list snapshots for a given repository.
- It sends the results to the server over the WebSocket connection.

## Uvicorn Server

- The run_uvicorn function runs a Uvicorn server to serve the FastAPI application.

### Main

- The main function is the entry point for the script.
- It runs the agent and run_uvicorn functions concurrently using asyncio.gather.
- Overall, this script appears to be a part of a larger system that provides a web interface for monitoring and backup functionality. It establishes connections to a server using WebSockets and RabbitMQ, and handles various message types to perform tasks like listing repository snapshots.
