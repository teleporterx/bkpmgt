# Overview of the Server Code
## Components
1. FastAPI App: The main application is built using FastAPI, which provides a web framework for building APIs.
2. WebSocket Manager: The ConnectionManager class handles WebSocket connections, including establishing connections, sending and receiving messages, and managing queues for each connected client.
3. GraphQL API: The code includes a GraphQL API using Strawberry, a Python GraphQL library. The API provides queries and mutations for interacting with the system.
4. MongoDB Database: The code uses Motor, an async MongoDB driver, to interact with a MongoDB database. The database is used to store client status and other data.
5. RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ is used for message queuing, allowing the system to handle tasks asynchronously.
6. Authentication: The code includes authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are used to verify the identity of clients connecting to the WebSocket endpoint.
## Key Features
- WebSocket Endpoint: The /ws/{system_uuid} endpoint establishes a WebSocket connection with a client, allowing for bi-directional communication.
- GraphQL API: The GraphQL API provides queries and mutations for interacting with the system, such as allocating tasks and retrieving client status.
- Task Allocation: The system allows for task allocation, where a client can request a task to be performed, and the system will publish the task to a RabbitMQ queue for processing.
- Client Status: The system stores client status in the MongoDB database, which can be retrieved using the GraphQL API.
- Authentication: The system uses JWT authentication to verify the identity of clients connecting to the WebSocket endpoint.
## Complexity
The codebase is moderately complex, with multiple components and features interacting with each other. The use of async/await syntax and coroutines adds to the complexity, but it also allows for efficient and scalable handling of concurrent connections.

# Overall
This codebase appears to be a robust and scalable system for managing WebSocket connections, task allocation, and client status, with a focus on security and performance.
